# Secure Mailer



<u>You try to open the Mailing site. So you have to try following steps.</u>

1. *You have to sign in https://www.emailjs.com/.*
2. *And then you pay to this site, because you try to attatch file.*

Email is one of service.
But text-content is free, file-content is not when you send mail without ready-made mail site.

Enjoy!
